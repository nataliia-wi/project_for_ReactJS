            <p>Welcome to the Notes Sharing Service, a project developed by Natalia Serbina as part of a ReactJS course.</p>
            <p>This service is designed for easy note sharing. Simply create a note, share the provided link with a friend, and they will be able to view it. Once the note is viewed, it will be automatically deleted, or it will expire after 15 minutes from the time of creation.</p>
            <p>This tool ensures quick, temporary communication, allowing users to share information without leaving a lasting footprint.</p>
